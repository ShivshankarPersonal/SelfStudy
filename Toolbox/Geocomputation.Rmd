## Introduction

Prior to the __`sp`__ package (2005), geographic coordinates were generally treated like any other number. This package changed R landscape by providing classes and generic methods supporting points, lines, polygons and grids, and attribute data. Along with other packages, like __`rgdal`__ and __`rgeos`__ (for geometric operations), R's spatial ecosystem has been evolving continuously throughout the years. Most recently, the __`sf`__ and __`raster`__ packages have become very popular.

The following sections introduce two fundamental geographic data models: _vector_ and _raster_.

- Vector data tends to dominate the social sciences because human settlements tend to have discrete borders.

- Raster often dominates in environmental sciences because of the reliance on remote sensing data.

There is much overlap between both types of data structures.

### Vector data

The _vector data model_ represents the world using points, lines and polygons. These have discrete, well-defined borders, meaning that vector datasets usually have a high level of precision (but not necessarily accuracy).

This type of data is based on points located within a geographic _coordinate reference system_ (CRS). In this system, the origin is located at zero degrees longitude (the Prime Meridian) and 0 degrees latitude (the Equator). Other projected CRS can have different values, but they all represent some measure of distance from an origin.

___An introduction to the `sf` package___

Simple Features refers to a standard data model that represents a wide range of geometry types. The following seven geometries are fully supported by `sf`:

```{r, out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/sf-classes.png")
```

Note that _points_, _lines_, and _polygons_ are the main building blocks.

All sf objects are data frames with special geometry columns. For example, the `spData::world` has a _list-column_ named "geom" which contains all the coordinates of the country polygons in the world.

```{r}
spData::world["name_long"]
```

Notice that the geometry information is always kept unless the user deliberately removes it. 

The geometry column is of class `sfc` (simple feature column). In turn, sfc objects are composed of one or more objects of class `sfg` (simple feature geometry).

```{r}
spData::world$geom %>% class
spData::world$geom[[1]] %>% class
```

These classes are designed to work with many "methods", such as:

```{r}
methods(class = "sf")
```


```{r}
## Two ways of extracting geometry columns (or SFCs):
identical(
  spData::world$geom,                 # first
  st_geometry(spData::world)      # second
  )

geom <- st_geometry(spData::world)
```





```{r}
## LINESTRING (0 3, 0 4, 1 5, 2 5)
(s1 <- rbind(c(0, 3), c(0, 4), c(1, 5), c(2, 5)))
(ls <- st_linestring(s1))
plot(ls)

s2 <- rbind(c(0.2,3), c(0.2,4), c(1,4.8), c(2,4.8))
s3 <- rbind(c(0,4.4), c(0.6,5))
dfl <- list(s1 = s1, s2 = s2, s3 = s3)

(mls <- st_multilinestring(dfl))

plot(mls)

tibble::enframe(dfl) %>% 
  mutate(value = map(value, as_tibble)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(V1, V2, group = name)) + geom_line()

```









```{r}
world_asia = spData::world[spData::world$continent == "Asia", ]
asia = st_union(world_asia)

plot(spData::world["pop"], reset = FALSE)
plot(asia, add = TRUE, col = "red")

plot(spData::world["continent"], reset = FALSE)
cex = sqrt(spData::world$pop) / 10000
world_cents = st_centroid(spData::world, of_largest = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(world_cents), add = TRUE, cex = cex)

india = spData::world[spData::world$name_long == "India", ]
plot(st_geometry(india), expandBB = c(0, 0.2, 0.1, 1), col = "gray", lwd = 3)
plot(world_asia[0], add = TRUE)


ggplot() + geom_sf(data = st_geometry(india)) +   hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc(base_family = "Avenir") 

```

vignette(package = "sf") # see which vignettes are available


vignette("sf1")          # an introduction to the package
```


### Raster data

The _raster data model_ divides the surface up into cells of constant size. Rasters aggregate spatially specific features to a given resolution, meaning that they are consistent over space and scalable (many worldwide raster datasets are available).
